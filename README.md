## Introduction

As part of a tech test, I was tasked with developing a simple react application to create a personalised business card.. This required a form to submit to Firebase for data handling. The following information was needed: Name, Job title, Business, Phone number, Email address, and Website. An optional logo was to be accounted for and the user should also be able to select the colour scheme for their card.

The data then needed to be retrieved and presented in a preview form, with a unique URL.

A basic design was provided by the organisation via adobe xd. The project required this to be followed for styling, using a css framework, I used Tailwind.

### Aims

The task should demonstrate the following technical core concepts:

- Modern, functional React components and managing state using hooks
- Database interaction
- Form data handling and validation
- Styling using CSS prototyping framework (eg: Tailwind)

## Technologies

- JavaScript
- React
- Node
- Firebase
- Tailwind
- HTML
- CSS

## Launch

To run this project locally, you'll need to do the following:

Make sure you're using at least node version v14.18.1

Use the 'code' button, on the repo page, to view the url and copy it

Open your terminal, navigate to the directory you want the repo to be in ('cd <chosen-directory>'), then enter: 'git clone <repo-url>'. For a more detailed set of instructions, please use this handy guide from the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

Once in your cloned repository, enter 'npm start' to run the project in the development mode

You'll also need to make sure the following dependencies are installed:

- React v-18.2.0
- Firebase v-9.9.3
- React-dom v-18.2.0
